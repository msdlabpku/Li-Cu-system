# LiCu-dataset
Introduction
This project contains the datasets for training Li potential models in the paper "A Deep Neural Network Interface Potential for Li-Cu Systems"

These datasets contain train and test datasets. They are generated by dpgen and Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The datasets can be directly used to trian a Li-Cu potential model using DeePMD-kit

Files
box.npy contains the lattice parameters information;

coord.npy contains the coordinate information;

energy.npy contains the calculated energy information;

force.npy contains the calculated force information;

virial.npy contains the calculated virial information;

type.raw contains elements information of each atoms for all configurations in the file;

type_map.raw map the elements information from the number to word.
